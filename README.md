Use this to control the volume of your system (only Windows).

Use your thumb and pointer finger.

Change a distance between them to control a volume. 
More distance - more volume. Less distance - less volume.

### Virtual Painter

This is an application for virtual paint using your web-camera (currently only 1280x720 is supported).

In the top of image from your webcam you see a header with 7 different colours and eraser at top right corner.

To pick a colour pick up your pointer finger and middle finger together as below.

Then point them at chosen colour. This colour will highlight a bit as below.

Then use your forefinger to draw. 

So when you put pointer finger and middle finger together - this is a selection mode, you can't draw.
